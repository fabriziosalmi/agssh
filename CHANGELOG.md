## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- **AGSSH-STD-001 v1.0.0** — property-based, risk-proportional conformance standard
  for air-gapped static surfaces: 57 rules across 9 families, three cumulative
  profiles (Bronze ⊂ Silver ⊂ Gold), assurance tiers, governed waivers, and signed
  external attestation. Rendered PDF plus a single-source generator that emits both
  the document and the runner's rule manifest.
- **`agssh`** — deterministic, fail-closed runner: single static Go binary, native
  DNS (`miekg/dns`) and TLS (`crypto/tls`), headless verification via `chromedp`,
  signing via `cosign`. Verification planes: static, dns, tls, dynamic, supply, ci,
  engine.
- GitHub Action wrapper (`action.yml`) with `conformant` / `report` step outputs,
  running from a prebuilt image published to `ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/agssh`. Runtime
  image (`Dockerfile`) pinned to a base digest.
- CI: build, `go vet`, `gofmt`, `go test -race`, spec↔runner skew enforcement, and
  a goreleaser release pipeline.
